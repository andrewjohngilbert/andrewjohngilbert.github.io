# Biography
I am an  Associate Professor at the University of Surrey. Before joining becoming a Lecturer, I obtained my PhD from CVSSP with Richard Bowden. My research interests include Computer Vision, video understanding and Generative Models.

My Research ranges from research in intelligent creative arts such as fine grained style search and movie trailer genre understanding and 4D performance capture. Through to enabling machines to perceive and understand their surroundings with real-time accurate 3D human pose estimation for large-scale markerless motion capture for use both indoors and outdoors,  complex realistic activity recognition and early work on tracking people on vast surveillance networks.

I have published over 50 articles in the leading international vision conferences and journals providing state of the art advancements in this field.

 I'm a member of the [British Machine Vision Association (BMVA)](http://www.bmva.org/) Executive committee and coordinate the national BMVA technical meetings. bringing together key expert from industry and academia to discuss and identify solutions to current problems in specialist areas of the computer vision and machine learning field.

# PhD Students
I'm always looking for good PhD candidates but normally when I have funding available it is for UK students. This is sometimes due to restrictions on the funding but more often than not more to do with the difference between home and overseas fees. However, if you are an exceptional candidate, then drop me an email. I am happy to work with high calibre candidates to obtain scholarships either internally or from external funders such as the China Scholarship Council or the Commonwealth Scholarship Council.
