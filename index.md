# PhD Students
I'm always looking for good PhD candidates but normally when I have funding available it is for UK students. This is sometimes due to restrictions on the funding but more often than not more to do with the difference between home and overseas fees. However, if you are an exceptional candidate, then drop me an email. I am happy to work with high calibre candidates to obtain scholarships either internally or from external funders such as the China Scholarship Council or the Commonwealth Scholarship Council.
